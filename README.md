## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure

Here's a quick overview of the key topics covered:

- **DOM** â€” Practical examples for selecting and manipulating the Document Object Model.
- **advanced** â€” Concepts like closures, hoisting, timers, and async patterns.
- **classes_opp** â€” Object-oriented JavaScript: classes, constructors, and inheritance.
- **control flow** â€” `ifâ€¦else`, switch, and logical comparisons.
- **events** â€” Handling mouse clicks, keyboard input, and other DOM events.
- **iterations** â€” Loops: `for`, `while`, `forâ€¦of`, `forâ€¦in`, and array traversal.
- **Project1â€“Project6** â€” Mini-projects that bring concepts together in real use-cases.
- Individual files like:
  - `array.js` â€” Array operations and methods.
  - `functions.js` â€” Function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
  - `scope.js` â€” Let, var, const, and lexical scoping in JS.
